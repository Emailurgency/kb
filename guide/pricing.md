# Plans and Billing

## How billing is calculated

Emailurgency is a SaaS (software as a service) offering **3 monthly plans**.
Every subscription plan has a fixed part that covers access to features, number of concurrent countdowns and a certain amount of monthly views included. You pay a variable part of the bill based on the exceding quantity of monthly views as expalined below.

::: tip Views count
**Views** are counted everytime an user actually see your countdown. We do not count views performed within your personal dashboard (so feel free to work on and preview them as much as you want :smile:).
:::

::: tip Free Buttons
Since we generate animated buttons for download, you will embed them directly on your emails so they won't increase your views. Yey!
