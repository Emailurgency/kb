[Login to the dashboard](https://app.emailurgency.com/login) and click on create _Countdowns->Create_.

If you're on a paid plan you can chose between fixed date and dynamic date countdowns.

#### Fixed Date

When a countdown has a fixed date, you are required to choose an ending date and time. The countdown will count to the same ending date in every email.

#### Dynamic Date

With dynamic date, you choose a duration instead. The countdown will count to a date automatically calculated based on the sending date and time.

This solution is perfect for all cases where you need to send a different countdown for each email or group of emails (e.g. drip campaigns).

## Editor

Once you select the kind of countdown you need, you can **start designing your awesome countdown**.

### Name

You can give a name to each countdown for your future reference.
