# Introduction

[Emailurgency](https://emailurgency.com/) provides a GUI that let you easily design an animated countdown timer that displays real remaining time to the end of an offer or event.

The result is an image url that you can embed into emails or landing pages. The image itself is generated in real time with real data by our servers. It's therefore important that the actual URL from emailurgency is used and not a saved version of the image.

### Example of countdown timer :alarm_clock:
